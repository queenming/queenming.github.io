					<!--h5>rehash or refined? (lol)</h5-->
					<p class="left">I'm hyped to play this game.</p>
					<p class="left">Off the bat- I loved SMT IV, my first outing in the Shin Megami Tensei series, because law versus chaos is a superior discussion in a world of games exploring good versus evil, or worse, nice-good versus jerk-good. The opening choices (always in pairs) appear to be following the template of comfort/scorn. Combined with a teenage hero, the game looks to be dissolving into, giving it the benefit of the doubt, friendly vs loner. (Someone call Persona.) Without the benefit of the doubt, nice vs jerk.</p>
					<p class="left">At one of the first major events of the game (a false choice, do something voluntarily or be forced), I was shocked to find I wanted to do what Dagda ordered. I wanted to unleash an unknown quantity into the hellhole of Tokyo. I’m wanting to walk toward the power and the chaos in this game, perhaps a side effect of dropping me to the side of a story I already know is well-resolved. Sadly, it’s still appearing that chaos doesn’t exist in Apocalypse, only asshole alignment.</p>
					<p class="left">In my eyes, one of the worst mistakes a game can make is to undermine the theme of its story with its gameplay. In this game, partners clearly make you stronger in battle. They provide an extra action every turn. It’s a hard sell in cut scenes to claim they’re holding you back.</p>
					<p class="left">And yet, I can't put it down. I have to make one more risky foray into the world above, steal precious experience in an unforgiving battle system and scurry back to my hole. One more time, again. The gameplay is why I'm here.</p>
					<p class="left">Settled on a gun build.</p>
					<p class="left">At about 20 hours in I put this game down and haven't picked it back up. Huh.</p>
