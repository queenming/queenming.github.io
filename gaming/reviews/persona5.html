					<p class="left">This is a hell of a game, a huge and stylish mess, so these are just some thoughts as I go along.</p>
					<p class="left">I've been seeing a lot of "it's Japan" and "this game isn't intended for you" to excuse the excessive misogyny and homophobia. But, as a new fan of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, I'm comparing it to SMT IV which came out of the same damn studio with 100% fewer upskirt and gay predator jokes. It detracts from the quality of this game immensely when it's trying to deal seriously with sexual assault in the same breath.<p>
					<p class="left">Movement in dungeons is more than occasionally frustrating. Camera angles from cover are awful, causing the ambush prompt to sometimes vanish even when the enemy is very close. The dead zone in the center of the analogue stick seems unusually large, leading to a sometimes clumsy zero-to-100 feeling. This is a rare game where I wish the character would slow down a bit so I could move with more control.</p>
					<p class="left">Contrary to most of what I’ve read, I love going to Mementos. I adore the design progression through each floor, the character lines are funny and engaging, and seeing what new demon design your target will transform into is always a highlight. I love the battle system and the series's continually excellent demon negotiation mechanic. And on a list of loves, it goes without saying that the confidant paths are standouts in writing and voice acting. They also grant fantastic skills to depend the battle system even further.</p>
					<p class="left">The game excels at what it’s deservedly best known for- style, panache, and integrating systems. Bonding with confidants strengthens demons, strengthening demons helps in battle, battle earns you money to spend on strengthening your party, and money and the right demons can help you increase your bonds with your confidants. Bonding with some confidants increase the personal stats that you need to win over others. These are the systems that make the gameplay great, and these systems take a toll on the storyline. I would argue this game style is not the right media to tell the overarching story attempted here.</p>
					<p class="left">From highly telegraphed story beats later replayed from every angle as if they were unforeseeable, to moments where the confidant ranking system betrays any sort of fear or anticipation about the future of a character – oh no, we’re only at 7 out of 10, this isn’t the last we’ll see of them – the story falters. The characters urge you to take out palaces as quickly as possible because it’s good for gameplay, but then the story’s waiting period is accounted for in unsatisfactory ways.</p>
					<p class="left">The earlier palaces and scraps introduced toward the end seem to point to this game first being intended to follow an arc about the seven deadly sins. The game feels like it organically grew out of a planned structure, which brings, again, I think, gameplay and character blessings and over-arching story curses. Mixed signals abound as we learn through stealing treasures that every single person, every single villain, has their own sympathetic story about how they became who they are. At the same time, we trash the sheep-like masses, then turn and reprimand the ‘bad guys’ when they do the same. The game becomes more and more unfocused in its message as it continually ramps up the stakes.</p>
