					<p class="left">This is a hell of a game, so these are just some thoughts as I go along.</p>
					<p class="left">I've been seeing a lot of "it's Japan" and "this game isn't intended for you" to excuse the excessive misogyny and homophobia. But, as a new fan of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise, I'm comparing it to SMT IV which came out of the same damn studio with 100% fewer upskirt and gay predator jokes. It detracts from the quality of this game immensely, there are no two ways about it, especially when it's trying to deal seriously with sexual assualt in the same breath.<p>
					<p class="left">Movement in dungeons is more than occasionally frustrating. Camera angles from cover are awful, causing the ambush prompt to sometimes vanish even when the enemy is very close. The dead zone in the center of the analogue stick seems unusually large, and the protagonist skates a bit once they are moving. This is one of the rare games where I wish the character would slow down a bit so I could move with more control.</p>
					<p class="left">These are all complaints so far, oops, but there have been some bugs in characters' world recognition. More than once have I had teammates stop me at the train station before school to bug me about "all those requests" in Mementos when I had none available. I have a feeling that social links will splinter into alternate worlds from main story dialogue, too.</p>
