					<h2 class="whitetext">SHIN MEGAMI TENSEI IV: APOCALYPSE</h2>
					<p><kbd>ATLUS</kbd> <kbd>3DS</kbd> <kbd>2016</kbd></p>
					<!--h5>rehash or refined? (lol)</h5-->
					<p class="left">This game is SMT IV fanfiction, and mediocre fanfiction at that. When the old guard appears it’s often just a bit too good to be true, and the rest of the game is poorly written, struggles to stay coherent, and dips into embarrassingly immature.</p>
					<p class="left">I loved SMT IV, my first outing in the Shin Megami Tensei series, because law versus chaos is a superior discussion in a world of games exploring good versus evil, or worse, ‘polite good’ versus ‘rude good’. Unfortunately, in a turn from its predecessor, Apocalypse’s choices, mostly in pairs, boil down to comforting or scorning your teammates. Combined with teenage heroes and an embarrassing love triangle (revolving around you, the boy player, of course), this game’s themes are a serious regression from SMT IV.</p>
					<p class="left">To make matters so much worse, the game directly undermines any nuance it manages to cook up through your interesting god companion, Dagda, with the addition of partners to the SMT IV battle system. In this game, there is absolutely no denying that your teammates make you stronger in battle. You can select one of them to follow up your actions each turn, giving you an extra move in every round of battle. Each team member specializes in a different type of attack or support, and they were so reliable I found myself crafting my demon teams around their skills. As the player faces more and more choices between building a strong team and isolating themselves, the answers are clear. To get anything but the outrageously sweet ‘Kumbaya’ ending, one must directly reject their gameplay experience.</p>
					<p class="left">I feel like I’m kicking the game when it’s down here, but its story decisions often failed on yet another level. I was roleplaying a rather ruthless character, and in many instances the most self-focused, power-hungry answer was actually intended to be the touchy-feely one. An example- I told my most vulnerable teammate that I needed them in battle with me because their healing skills were too good to pass up. This put them in outrageous danger, way out of their depth, and the selfless choice would have been to tell them they should stay behind. But I got ‘happy’ points for that choice, like many others. Again, the story failures often center around the partner mechanic.</p>
					<p class="left">But the mechanics being so divorced from the rest of the game is simultaneously Apocalypse’s saving grace. This battle system is incredible. It’s improved on SMT IV’s, with new smirk effects, greater demon variation, the ability to re-arrange your and your demon’s skills, and the freedom to change the difficulty setting at any time. Tokyo is also much easier to navigate, with an upgraded mapping system featuring clearer labeling and quest markers, fixing a serious issue that marred the original SMT IV experience.</p>
					<p class="left">Because of the setting, challenge, and game mechanics, I couldn’t put it down. I groaned through cutscenes and cursed at choices, begging for the next fight. Just as with SMT IV, I needed to make one more risky foray into the world above, steal precious experience in an unforgiving battle system, and scurry back to my hole. One more time, again. The gameplay is the reason I managed to finish this game.</p>
					<p class="left">But this game, of course, could not even manage to end on a decent gameplay note. Be warned, the next paragraph includes descriptions of the final dungeon.</p>
					<p class="left">With about ten hours left, I mistakenly thought I was in end game, and it felt a little bittersweet. The battling was so good, and the final few side quests I had just cleared out were a joy. This, of course, was not the end game, and by the final dungeon, the game had already overstayed its welcome. And, wow, what a hellhole of a final dungeon it was. It seemed designed to make the maximum amount of players exhausted, frustrated, and possibly physically ill. With ugly, swirling textures on every possible surface, a long and confusing warp-riddled layout, and the removal of demon negotiation, everything fun was lost. My usually organically growing demon party was stagnant, I started avoiding battles for the first time in more than fifty hours, and I begged to be put out of my misery. I finally was, by the world’s cheesiest anime ending, completely tone-deaf to the exhaustion I felt and the serious outcome of the original SMT IV it splintered from.</p>
					<p class="left">SMT IV stumbled on a grand attempt; Apocalypse's polished packaging flounders in telling a story which was not worth delivering in the first place. A SMT IV Redux featuring the accessibility options and battle upgrades from this game will be an excellent entry into the SMT franchise, and then we can forget that the Apocalypse ever happened.</p>
