					<p class="left">Oxenfree does its best to involve you in a story instead of having you play a game. You talk and walk and occasionally tune a radio. You make your decisions through talking and walking, integrating decision-making seamlessly in the gameplay. Why, then, spoil the incredibly natural experience you've crafted through movement and wonderfully realistic dialogue with percentage signs over the credits? One of my biggest pet peeves is this parading of player choice statistics. It might be temporarily satisfying, but it's a huge sign that screams, "look at me! I'm a game!" like a high score or hit points. It doesn't fit when you're attempting to craft a narrative experience. </p>
					<p class="left"> Now that I've harped on about one minor issue, go play this game. A sad, spooky little indie experience that shows the video game world what it means to do dialogue right.</p>
