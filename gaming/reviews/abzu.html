					<p class="left">I started this game trying my best not to continually compare it to Journey, one of my favorite gaming experiences of the last ten years, but Abzu is just <i>so</i> "Underwater Journey" it's nearly impossible not to.</p>
					<p class="left">In its favor, I'm sure it would have benefitted from being played in one sitting, as I played Journey, but it wasn't just my schedule that interfered with this happening. Abzu felt repetitive, and it gave me my fill of pinging the environment and naming fish more than once.</p>
