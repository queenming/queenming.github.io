					<p class="left">Having played this game soon after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it was difficult not to feel trapped on the trails of the Firewatch's Shoshone. I never once was lost in the forest, and with only a map and compass to guide me, that felt like a detriment. A little more time spent creating an open, messy world would have furthered the theme this game seemed to be all about - life isn't tidy.</p>
					<p class="left">In that regard, Firewatch's plot was successful from beginning to end. That opinion seems to be a break in the general consensus, but I found the narrative cathartic and resonant. This is made possible by a gorgeously crafted soundscape and two spectacular voice performances. Delilah is especially successful, a character you can fall in love with and be pained to leave by just talking to her for a few hours. I recommend this game to anyone interested in unique or emotional gaming experiences.</p>
