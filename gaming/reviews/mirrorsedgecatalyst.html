					<h2 class="whitetext">mirror's edge catalyst</h2>

					<p class="left">I admit- I am a Mirror’s Edge fan. I love unique gameplay, and any game that builds itself around it will get a lot of love from me. I’m glad to say Mirror’s Edge Catalyst’s gameplay is improved on its unique but unpolished predecessor. Touches like quick swings around corners and a grappling hook seemed like low-use gimmicks at first, but ended up adding a lot to smooth out the parkour. Another bonus is the diverse cast - two black women, two white men, one Asian man and our main Asian lady. Zero objectification of any of them, all skilled and morally grey in their own ways. Fantastic.</p>

<p class="left">The highpoint of this game is the early middle, just introduced to those characters and set loose on the city. It’s a runner’s high. But all too soon I found myself fatigued by traversing the same pathways to reach story missions, and by the end of the game I had started reaching for that fast-travel button. It’s telling that a running game has need of a fast-travel button at all. The City of Glass is sectioned off, perhaps because of loading requirements, and getting from one area to another requires being funneled through the bottlenecks (bridges, tunnels) connecting them. The first few times through you learn and master them, the next few times you move through them mechanically, and finally you fast-travel. The open world first works for and then decidedly fails Catalyst.</p>

<p class="left">But here’s the real rub. This game’s story is so poorly concocted I didn't even realize this was a prequel until significantly into the game. Why they can't figure out a plot for a game that only needs the most basic bones is beyond me. The creators could learn from a work like Katamari Damacy – create an engaging stage and let the unique gameplay speak for itself. Catalyst’s terrible plot leaks into and spoils running much more than its predecessor, which mostly confined its story to animated shorts between missions. I’ll admit the final cut scene, in Catalyst’s 3D style, looked spectacular, but, seriously, what was even happening in it? It certainly didn’t seem to go out of its way to lead into the events of the first game, so why didn’t it at least go out of its way to be good? I’m at a loss.</p>

<p class="left">I both want to say this game is underrated and deserves the middling reviews it received. Both Mirror's Edge games go so very right in some places and so wrong in others, it's all difficult to quantify. Catalyst reaches higher highs and drags to lower lows, keeping it at about the same level as its predecessor. But thanks to that runner’s high, I still find myself recommending the series to anyone who puts value on gameplay you can’t find anywhere else.</p>
