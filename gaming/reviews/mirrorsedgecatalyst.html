					<p class="left">As far as the story's concerned, I honestly didn't even realize this was a prequel until significantly into the game. I was just confused. Why they can't figure out a plot for a game that only needs the most basic bones is beyond me. 
					 However, this game is improved on its unique but unpolished predecessor. Touches like quick swings around corners and a grappling hook seemed like low-use gimmicks at first, but ended up adding a lot to smooth out the parkour.
					 Another bonus is the diverse cast - two black women, two white men, one asian man and our main asian lady. Zero objectification of any of them, all skilled and morally grey in their own ways. Fantastic.</p>
					<br><p class="left">I'm halfway in, set loose on the city, and on a high, so to me this is the second underrated game in an underrated series. When the story comes crashing in again in the last acts, I fear I may feel quite differently (like many others do).</p>
