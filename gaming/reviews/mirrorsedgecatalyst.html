					<p class="left"><b>bad story</b> - I honestly didn't even realize this was a prequel until significantly into the game. I was just confused.<br>
					<b>great gameplay</b> - this game improved on its unique but unpolished predecessor! touches like quick swings around corners and a grappling hook seemed like low-use gimmicks at first, but ended up adding a lot to smooth out the parkour.<br>
					<b>diverse cast</b> - two black women, two white men, one asian man and our main asian lady. zero objectification of any of them. fantastic.</p>
					<br><p class="left">this is the second underrated game in an underrated series!</p>
