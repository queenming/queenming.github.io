					<p class="left">I'm impressed so far. Without the experience share item on, 
					I've found it easy to keep level with the wild pokemon even while taking my time to catch 'em all, 
					and I've found the totem pokemon to be challenging!<br>
					Those two details together encouraged me to switch up my team. (Ex. fletchinder before the jungle, ribombee to take on raticates in po town)
					This is an incredibly enjoyable way to play Pokemon, particularly with the many forms to discover and collect in this installment.<br>
					Quests available to pick up in the Pokemon Centers also encourage a thorough and varied style of play.</p>
					<p class="left">Still displeased with the gender-locked hairstyles and clothing. I want a "modern quiff" and a skirt! Get with it.</p>
					<p class="left">The battle with the Champion was so difficult! The available pokemon and the story are nothing special; the locations are nice but don't make the game. 
					It's the trainers, totems, and kahunas in your path to battle that shine in this game. It didn't reach the ecstatic, franchise-reviving experience I had with the DexNav of Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (why did they remove it?!), 
					but <i>Moon</i> is definitely one of the better installments in the series.</p>
