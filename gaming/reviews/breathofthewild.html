					<h2 class="whitetext">BREATH OF THE WILD</h2>
					<p><kbd>NINTENDO</kbd> <kbd>SWITCH</kbd> <kbd>2017</kbd></p>
					<p class="left">The framing of this game is genius. By setting up that the kingdom prepared for Ganon and still lost to him, everything you do - from scaling a mountain to get a good sightline to upgrading your armor to training a horse - is the story. Your preparations are the story, you discovering and surmounting your previous strength is the story, and this sets up one of the grandest and most individualized journeys in video game history. </p>
					<p class="left">However, the delivery of that background scaffolding could really use restructuring. Three different times in the first few hours I saw and heard the same story of the fight with Ganon in the old days. Particularly the king laying it all out and then sending you to Impa to lay it all out again drains the mystery from a game partly about reclaiming memories.</p>
					<p class="left">There are many ways the flow of the early story could be changed for the better. Perhaps the King could focus, rightfully so, on his daughter and her connection to the Sheikah Slate he’s just been teaching you to use. Perhaps he sends you directly to Hateno to fix it – a place I gravitated to before Impa directed me there. After fixing your slate, the Sheikah at Hateno naturally send you to their leader, Impa. On the road along the way you recover your first location-specific memory, and finally Impa tells you the whole grand tale and marks the four corners of your map. Simple, with a sense of discovery.</p>
					<p class="left">Other than that and the abominable voice acting, is there anything else negative to say about Breath of the Wild? I’ve played the first twenty hours on three different saves because I don’t want it to ever be over. And what varied first hours they were! I can't imagine all of the different ways this game has been played across the globe. This is the kind of game you write letters to the creators thanking them for it. A masterpiece.</p>
