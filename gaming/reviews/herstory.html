					<p class="left">This game just works. This, in spite of being maligned as not even a game - less than you can do in a youtube session, is a game by someone who knows how to make them.</p>
					<p class="left">Interrogations, despite being abundant in games, are some of the worst gaming experiences. You can't follow your intuition, you can't ask the questions you want to, and any kind of urgency spoils rather than enhances the experience.
					Her Story cuts through all that by already answering all of the relevant questions and handing you the reigns to use your intuition to find the answers. 
					Small tweaks in the old database system set just enough roadblocks in your way to keep you working at the mystery without distracting your attention, and often while adding to the 90s PC ambience.</p>
					<p class="left">Finally, its hands-off approach and ambiguity set up a game that ends simply when you feel satisfied. Perhaps you will feel satisfied because you think you know her story. But maybe you won't! Perhaps, like me, you'll leave satisfied in the mechanics that lead you to it.</p>
