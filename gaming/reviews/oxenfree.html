					<p class="left">Oxenfree does its best to involve you in a story instead of simply having you play a game. Player actions are limited to talking, walking, and occasionally tuning a radio. Your decisions are organically made through what you say and where you walk, integrating them seamlessly into the gameplay. Why, then, spoil this incredibly natural experience with player choice statistics – pie charts and percentage signs – over the credits? It’s a neon sign that screams, "Look at me! I'm a game!" like a high score or hit points. It just doesn't fit when you're attempting to craft a narrative experience. </p>
					<p class="left"> Now that I've harped on about just one post-game issue, go play this game! A sad, spooky little indie experience that shows the video game world how to create and deliver immersive, interactive, realistic dialogue. </p>
