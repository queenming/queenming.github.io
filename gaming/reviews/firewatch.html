					<p class="left">Having played this game so soon after the release of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, it was difficult not to feel trapped by the trails of Firewatch's Shoshone National Forest. I never once was lost in the woods, and with only a scribbled-on paper map and compass in hand to guide me, that felt like a detriment. A little more time spent creating an open, messy world would have furthered the theme this game seemed to be all about - life isn't tidy.</p>
					<p class="left">In that regard, Firewatch's plot was successful from beginning to end. That seems to be a break in the general consensus, but I found the narrative about two people connecting in a strange place in their lives to be cathartic and resonant. A gorgeously crafted soundscape, thorough and flexible script, and two spectacular voice actors allow the player to experience grief, loneliness, fear, distrust, annoyance, amusement, wonder, and genuine interpersonal connection. Delilah's performance is particularly effective. Despite most of your few hours together being spent chatting about mundane actions or whatever happens to be in your hand, the actor has brought to life a character you can fall in love with and be pained to leave. I definitely recommend this game to anyone interested in unique or emotional gaming experiences.</p>
